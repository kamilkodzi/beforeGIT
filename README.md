# Hi, and wellcome in to my beforeGit section.
Whole code was written before i`v learned git (it is not optimized like common project- I used notepad and notepad++). 
It`s only a part of my work- that what left or i can show. What is the meaning of the phrase "write"?
In my case it`s means deep understanding of "HOW IT WORK" with all dependencies involved in even single line. 
So it`s possible that one 5 minutes episode of programming web tutorial can take me 20 hours to understand how it works.
I treat courses like collecting new skills: when i collect enough i can start with own projects.

## What you can find up there:
*a_c - I started from making my own sorting library and finish at creating small games and tools like notepad. I learned concept of object programming also.
        Thanks to channel of [Mirosław Zelent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn6vAfspIcagLax1fck_jw) I could improve my work with VBA code.
        Each line from the web cours has been rewritten and understood by me ofc however there is not much of my creativity there.

*b_webdevelop -both curses are connected- same channel [Mirosław Zelent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn6vAfspIcagLax1fck_jw). 
        After learning obecting programming i just realized that i want change platform for my present code.

*c_vba - 99% of my own creativity even with ideas(all are used in production). Some small proof that Excel is powerfull tool ;).
        My skills evolve in this topic due to my present work specification.


In case of VBA you can find piece of "good" code which can be used in your projects. 
Some of them are more objected than other. All of them are still used in production and help lot of people to organise their work. 
If you will need more explanation feel free to ask.
